# Network Visualization And Optimization
# Netzwerkvisualisierung version 1.0

This project for study purpose. The application of visualizing network graph.

## Getting Started

These instructions will aid you to prepare the necessary environment for the application

### Support demo

* There are 3 files in "support" folder which support for demo and testing.

* Two *.graphml files contain the graph data.

* One *. csv file contains the throughput data.

### Warning

* The throughput file was generated randomly. Therefore, when testing with throughput statistic, the total number of edges maynot correct because some edges have throughput higher than their bandwidth or capapicity. Therefore those links are not calculated in a chart but still visualized in a graph
